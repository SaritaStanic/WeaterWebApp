Weather application in pink
"The task in this assignment is to pick one dataset from any government open data website and create an application that dynamically provides a visualisation for that data that makes it much easier to understand the impact of the data.
Your application must contain the following:

1.	A client component that is a web site.  You may make this using just client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc) or you may also contain some server-side components written in PHP. 

2.	A server component that is a web service that implements a REST or SOAP API that must be used by your client. The web service must retrieve the data to be visualised from a relational database.  Data must be transferred between the client and web service in either JSON or XML format.
	
3.	The visualisation must be generated dynamically at run-time using data supplied by the web service.(??)
	
4.	All server components (both the web service and any server components of the web site if you create a client web site) must be written in PHP 


You are free to provide any form of visualisation of the data source you choose to use.  To give you some ideas, here are some possibilities, but you are not restricted to these:
•	A game that varies its behaviour depending on the data in the data source;
•	If the data is geographical data, you might choose to display it as locations on a map;
•	You could choose to represent it graphically on a chart or other form of graph."
